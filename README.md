# Microsoft30DaysOfCode


Kickoff
In the #30DaysOfDataScience we will go from understanding the Python language to working with real life data and finally creating Machine Learning models both on Azure and in Python. The main role is understanding our data and using the knowledge to make decisions such as clustering Nigerian music based on their 'danceability' score, 'acousticness', loudness, 'speechiness', popularity and energy.
